<h1>Hadoop Exercise to Create an Inverted Index</h1>
<br>For this project you will be creating an Inverted Index of words occurring in a set of web pages. Weâ€™ll be using a subset of 74 files from a total of 408 files (text extracted from HTML tags) derived from the Stanford WebBase project that is available here. It was obtained from a web crawl done in February 2007. It is one of the largest collections totaling more than 100 million web pages from more than 50,000 websites. This version has been cleaned for the purpose of this assignment.
