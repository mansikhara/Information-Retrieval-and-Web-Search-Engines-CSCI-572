<h1>Web Search Engine Comparison</h1>
<br>The exercise is about comparing the search results from Google versus Bing, the two leading US search engines. Many search engine comparison studies have been done. All of them use samples of data, some small and some large, so no general conclusions can be drawn. But it is always instructive to see how the two search engines match up, even on a small data set.
<br>The process you will follow is to issue a set of queries and to evaluate the returned results for relevance. These studies do not seek to answer the ultimate question of which search engine is “best”. Rather we stick to more modest research questions which are:
<br>- Which search engine performs best when considering the first five results for a given query?
<br>- Is there a difference in relevance between the search engines when considering informational queries and navigational queries, respectively?
