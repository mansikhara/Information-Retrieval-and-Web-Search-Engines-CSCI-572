<h1>Adding Spell Checking, AutoComplete and Snippets to Your Search Engine</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<br>o Experience using a third-party spell program
<br>o Developing efficient methods for accomplishing autocomplete
<br>o Implementing a simple snippet feature for search results
<br>In the previous document (AutocompleteInSolr.pdf) you saw how to enhance the Solr program with spelling correction and an autocomplete (suggest) function. In this exercise you are asked to use an external spelling correction program in conjunction with Solr and to enhance the autocomplete functionality of Solr. In addition, the search results you return should include, in addition to a link to the resulting web page, a snippet that includes one or more of the query keywords. In the case of spelling correction, you may use an existing third-party program adapted to your downloaded files. In the case of autocomplete you will need to enhance your client program that communicates with Solr to deliver autocomplete suggestions to the web interface you created in an earlier homework. In the case of snippets, you will need to locate a string in the web page that includes the query terms and output that sentence along with the link results.
